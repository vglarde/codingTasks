# Coding Tasks (HyperionDev Bootcamp)

Some tasks completed during a **Data Science Skills Bootcamp** with *HyperionDev* (CoGrammar).

* **[Handling Missing Data](https://github.com/vglarde/codingTasks/tree/master/Handling_Missing_Data)** – (Python) Function designed to fill missing ages on the Titanic Dataset, based on passenger demographics. 

* **[K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/vglarde/codingTasks/tree/master/K-means_Clustering)** – (Data analysis) Grouping countries using socio-economic and health factors to determine the development status of the country.

* **[Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/vglarde/codingTasks/tree/master/Decision_Trees_and_Random_Forests)** – This task involved creating and measuring the accuracy of different models, then determine which is the most important feature predicting whether a passenger of the Titanic would survive or not.
